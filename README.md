## Quick Start

1. Attach suitable antennas:
     - 2.4‚ÄØGHz antenna to the Wi‚ÄëFi SMA
     - 433‚ÄØMHz antenna to the Sub‚ÄëGHz SMA
2. Plug the module onto GPIO
3. Enable the Wi‚ÄëFi or Sub‚ÄëGHz power switch on the module
4. Use Flipper‚Äôs serial/terminal to interact with ESP32 or integrate the CC1101 into your Sub‚ÄëGHz workflows

## ESP32 Marauder (short guide)

The firmware for this module is located in the `Firmware` directory of this repository. It is a fixed version of Marauder 1.8.6, modified to compile and upload for the ESP32-PICO-V3-02 chip used in this device. The project uses PlatformIO for building and flashing.

Precompiled `.bin` files are available in the repository releases as `MARAUDER_v1.8.6_ESP32_PICO_V3_02.zip`. The release contains:
- `bootloader.bin`
- `firmware.bin`
- `firmware.elf`
- `partitions.bin`

### Flashing precompiled binaries

1. Connect your ESP32-PICO-V3-02 module via USB-TTL to your computer.
2. Use [esptool.py](https://github.com/espressif/esptool) or similar tool to flash the binaries:
    ```sh
    esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 460800 write_flash -z 0x1000 bootloader.bin 0x8000 partitions.bin 0x10000 firmware.bin
    ```
    Adjust the serial port as needed.

### Building and flashing with PlatformIO

1. Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) (VS Code extension or CLI).
2. Open the `Firmware` folder in PlatformIO.
3. Select the correct environment for ESP32-PICO-V3-02.
4. Click "Build" to compile the firmware.
5. Click "Upload" to flash directly to the chip.

For more details, see the PlatformIO documentation or the Marauder firmware README.

## RF, Safety, and Compliance

- Use properly tuned antennas for 2.4‚ÄØGHz and 433‚ÄØMHz.
- Do not transmit without an antenna connected to avoid RF stage damage.
- Observe local regulations and duty‚Äëcycle/ERP limits for ISM bands.
- Regulatory status: not certified. For lab/experimental use only. User is responsible for legal compliance and safe operation.
- Do not use in life‚Äësupport, safety‚Äëcritical, or mission‚Äëcritical systems.

## FAQ

- Does it support Marauder?  
    Yes. The ESP32‚ÄëPICO‚ÄëV3‚Äë02 is wired for ESP32 Marauder support.

- Is CC1101 fixed to 433‚ÄØMHz only?  
    The design and matching are optimized for 433‚ÄØMHz. CC1101 can target other sub‚ÄëGHz bands, but follow the schematic/matching network and your local regulations.

- Where is the pinout?  
    See the schematic (doc/sch.png).
